# RPKM-time-plots
Script creates plot of RPKM by developmental stage based on genes defined by the user. Matches ensembl IDs in dataset to HGNC gene symbols, user inputs desired HGNC 
symbol, if HGNC symbol is in the dataset then script will produce a plot of the mean RPKM of each specified gene at each developmental stage.
